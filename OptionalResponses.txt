<img :src="hovered ? drink.images.back : drink.images.front" />

The above is a line of code I had in my DrinkInfoCard.vue file.

Vue evaluates drink.images.back immediately when rendering the component...
If drink.images is undefined -> for example, the fetch hasn’t completed yet or the JSON hasn’t loaded, it
throws a runtime error.

I learned that I need to instead do this:
:src="hovered ? drink.images?.back : drink.images?.front"

This allows JS to not just immediately error out i.e. the ?. operator tells JavaScript: 
“If drink.images is undefined or null, don’t throw an error; just return undefined.”

So instead of crashing, the img tag’s src becomes undefined.

This is something I got stuck on for a hot minute (20 minutes) and was the source of why nothing was appearing
beneath my welcome message. Vue is a relatively new thing for me, but I wanted to make use of it now, as you 
mentioned it being your primary framework, so no better time than the present to get familiarized with it. I have
only used it once before, but it was a very small scale media player I was just fooling around with.

Vue.js is really cool and I am glad that I picked this up now it is a good framework and actually is much easier than
using just straight vanilla JavaScript. I didn't realize how nice a framework could be.

Another huge thing I got from this, is I now fully understand what Vite is and how amazing it is
that you can npm run dev and dynamically see changes. This is so incredibly useful and wayyyy better then
the vanilla set-up I was using before. I don't think I will really go back to vanilla JS methods of coding after
using Vue. I want to try others going forwards, but better stick to Vue for now and learn one thing at a time!
